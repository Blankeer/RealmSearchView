#SearchView with result list powered by Realm

The `RealmSearchView` extends Android's `SearchView` widget. This is an much simpler and more versatile approach than [Thorbenprimke's original](https://github.com/thorbenprimke/realm-searchview) `RealmSearchView` which implements a wrapper around a `EditText` and `RealmRecyclerView`. It's build on top of `RealmRecyclerView` and `RealmBasedRecyclerViewAdapter`.

It's easily customizable via layout attributes and adapter parameters.

##How to include in your project:

**Step 1.** Add the JitPack repository to your build file

Add it in your [root build.gradle](https://github.com/LNSD/RealmSearchView/blob/master/build.gradle#L22) at the end of repositories:
``` gradle
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}
```

**Step 2.** Add the dependency to your [module build.gradle](https://github.com/LNSD/RealmSearchView/blob/master/example/build.gradle#L37):

``` gradle
	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.lnsd:RealmSearchView:v0.1.0'
	}
```

##How to get started:

The `RealmSearchView` extends Android's `SearchView` widget. The `RealmSearchAdapter` has added functionality for the filtering of the Realm. The snippet below shows how to include the `RealmSearchView` in your  layout file.

``` xml
    <es.lnsd.realmsearchview.RealmSearchView
        android:id="@+id/search_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:rsvHint="@string/search_hint"
        />
```

A `RealmRecyclerView` is required to show the results list.

``` xml
    <co.moonmonkeylabs.realmrecyclerview.RealmRecyclerView
            android:id="@+id/realm_recycler_view"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            app:layout_behavior="@string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior"
            app:rrvLayoutType="LinearLayout"
            app:rrvEmptyLayoutId="@layout/empty_view" />
```

The `associateRealmRecyclerView()` method **MUST** be called before calling the `setAdapter()`.

``` java
    @Bind(R.id.search_view) RealmSearchView searchView;
    @Bind(R.id.realm_recycler_view) RealmRecyclerView recyclerView;
```

``` java
	@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    	[â€¦]
        searchView.associateRealmRecyclerView(recyclerView);
        searchView.setAdapter(adapter);
    }
```

##The `RealmSearchView` attributes:

* `rsvHint`: This is the search box hint. It a string reference.

##RealmSearchAdapter

The adapter does all the filtering. The following list of parameters are available to customize the filtering.

* `filterKey`: The filterKey is required as it is the columnName that the results are filtered by.

* `useContains`: If true, uses `contains`, otherwise uses `beginsWith`.

* `useCaseSensitive`: If true, ensures that the filter is respecting casing. If false, ignores any casing.

* `sortAscending`: If true, ascending, otherwise descending.

* `sortKey`: The columnName by which the results should be sorted.

* `basePredicate`: The basePredicate is used to filter the results whenever the searchBar is empty.

The `RealmSearchAdapter` has two constructors. One that only takes the `filterKey` parameter and one that takes all parameters.
In addition, the adapter has to be provided with a valid instance of Realm. It is used throughout the life of view to requery the results.

##Work in progress!
This library is currently under develpment. I would love to hear your feedback. Do you find the `RealmSearchView` useful? What functionality are you missing? Open a `Github` issue and let me know. Thanks!
